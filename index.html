	<h1>What I've Learned In Coding Class</h1>
	<p>Hello, it's Emma here, and this blog post is about what I've learned about coding this year. Before I started coding class this year, the only impression I had of coding was the green numbers running down the screen in The Matrix: <img src= "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XAIeH9_UtH8/maxresdefault.jpg" alt= "falling matrix code numbers" width= "100"> Now I know a thousand times more about coding than I did then. Ok, maybe not quite a thousand, but at least several hundred. Today I'll tell you about some of the things I've learned. </p>
<p>These are the three coding languages I've learned so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#js">JavaScript</a></li>
<li><a href="#html">HTML</a></li>
<li><a href="#css">CSS</a></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3 id="js">In JS I've learned how to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create shapes</li>
<li>Add color to the shapes</li>
<li>Create variables</li>
<li>Animate</li>
<li>How computer mice can interact with a drawing program</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3 id="html">In HTML I've learned how to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create tags</li>
<li>Edit text using tags</li>
<li>Create lists</li>
<li>Insert internal and external links into text</li>
<li>Create tables</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3 id="css">In CSS I've learned how to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use CSS selectors</li>
<li>Use CSS properties</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>To Elaborate:</h3>
<p>HTML and CSS go hand-in-hand with each other. CSS basically modifies HTML; it adds fancy stuff like fonts, color, text size,  etc. HTML and CSS are the programming languages used to create websites. JavaScript is used for creating computer programs like games and other apps. </p>
<h4>Tags:</h4>
<p>Tags are what create paragraphs and headings and links and everything else in HTML.</p>
<h4>Lists:</h4>
<p>There are two types of lists: ordered and unordered. Ordered lists are numbered lists, while unordered lists are bullet points.</p>
<h4>Tables:</h4>
<p>Tables are really complicated to make, and they require a lot of tag memorization.</p>
<h4>CSS Selectors:</h4>
<p>They select all of an element (e.g. all paragraphs) or and id or class in order to modify it. </p>
<h4>CSS Properties:</h4>
<p>Add things like color and font.</p>
<h4>Ids and Classes:</h4>
<p>You can add an id to a certain paragraph or heading or whatever, and then use CSS to modify only the tag with that specific id. A class is pretty much an id added to multiple tags; it allows you to modify several things in the same way.</p>
<h4>Links:</h4>
<p>There are internal and external links. Internal links take you to a certain place within the page that you're in, while external links take you to different page entirely.</p>
<p></p>
<p>So basically, I've learned a lot, but I obviously haven't learned nearly everything. There is always more to know, and I will continue learning.</p>
	    <h2>My Business Idea:</h2>
	    <p>My business idea is a Rubik's Cube website or app. My brother loves Rubik's Cubes, so I thought 'what if you could do it online or in an app?' I couldn't do it with my current skills, but... Maybe someone has already done this, but that's my idea.</p>
